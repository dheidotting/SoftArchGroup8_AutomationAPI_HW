# SoftwareArchitecture Group 8 - Automation API HW
## Estimation
We estimated the lab would take about 2 hours.  We got this from the fact the lab had well documented slides and the lab seemed straight forward.  This estimate was fairly accurate as it took around 2:30-3 hours for us to complete as we took a lot of time trying to figure out how to get HTMLs to github.  After trying to get them to push in a readable way, we decided to just put them there inside of a zip file.
## Doxygen HTML Files
Note: the htmls are in a zip file.  Apologies for not getting them in an easier to read way but we couldnâ€™t figure out how to get them to our repo as Github was not cooperating.
